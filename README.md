## 🛠️ Open Test Task: Crypto Payment Gateway( 4h )

> **This is an open test development task.** The platform currently has Premium ($50) and Elite ($99) subscription plans with Pay buttons on the Subscription page, but no payment system. 

### What needs to be built

#### 1. Supabase Schema

Add the following to the database:

```sql
...
```

#### 2. Backend API Endpoints

| Method | Endpoint | Description |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| POST | `/api/payments/request` | User submits payment info |
| GET | `/api/payments/requests` | Admin fetches all requests |
| POST | `/api/payments/requests/:id/approve` | Admin approves, activates subscription |
| POST | `/api/payments/requests/:id/reject` | Admin rejects request |

#### 3. Payment Modal (Frontend)

When user clicks Pay on the Subscription page, show a modal with:

- **Step 1:** Chain selector (support at least 20 networks — Ethereum, BSC, Polygon, Arbitrum, Optimism, Avalanche, Solana, etc.)
- **Step 2:** Display our wallet address + QR code, form for user name, email, and transaction hash
- **Step 3:** Confirmation screen after submission
